# Auxilio Api Server

#### by Robert Bruce

## Description

This is a back-end api server used to store user data generated by my [Auxilio](https://github.com/entegral/auxilio) react proejct. It currently offers basic CRUD functionality for users, and organizations and will eventually provide a comprehensive set of functions that will be used to manage the given data.

It is worth noting that this project was created to offer basic persistence to a react project that was part of my Epicodus schooling/capstone. It is likely to change in drastic ways, and might even use a different language/framework in future implementations.

## Usage

1. Ensure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is installed on your system.
2. clone this repo and ```cd``` into it.
3. Run ```docker-compose up```
4. Docker should start downloading the necessary images and build your instance. 
5. This is an alpha build and this container SHOULD BE USED FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY, NOT PRODUCTION. Do not store personally identifiable information on it.
