# Auxilio Api Server

#### by Robert Bruce

## Description

This is a back-end api server (currently deployed [here](https://desolate-plains-77764.herokuapp.com/)) used to store user data generated by my [Auxilio](https://github.com/entegral/auxilio) react proejct. It currently offers basic CRUD functionality for users, and organizations and will eventually provide a comprehensive set of functions that will be used to manage the given data.

It is worth noting that this project was created to offer basic persistence to a react project that was part of my Epicodus schooling/capstone. It is likely to change in drastic ways, and might even use a different language/framework in future implementations.

## Usage

1. Ensure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is installed on your system.
2. clone this repo and ```cd``` into it.
3. Run ```docker-compose up```. Docker should start downloading the necessary images and start building your local image.
4. Open a new terminal window or tab (in the same folder) and run ```docker-compose run web rake db:create db:migrate```
5. The container should be setup to respond to api calls made to http://localhost:3000. Ensure the 'const link' in [auxilioServerApi.js](https://github.com/entegral/auxilio/blob/master/src/apis/auxilioServerApi.js) is pointing to this address.
6. This is an alpha build and this container SHOULD BE USED FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY, NOT PRODUCTION. Do not store personally identifiable information on it.
